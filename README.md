# Bald Mountain RPG

Bald Mountain is a small RPG made in Python to run in a terminal. I was inspired on the first generation of RPG games for computers where the player needed to type the decisions and actions on the screen to move on the game. The lack of any graphic or animation force the player to use the imagination as reads the outcomes on the screen.
